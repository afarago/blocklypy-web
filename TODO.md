# List of TODO items

## NEXT
- add list variable fns and expressions
- multi motor handlers
- device type - register properties that can be changed from default value / accept or reject it
- session based running instead of static registry / clear up states --> remove global registries...
- convert RegistryManager for variables and procedures

## LATER
- variables, lists, broadcasts - registry by id, also handling duplicates
- some converters cannot handle dynamic expressions and variables (e.g. global brightness)
- optimize comments
- add animations (manifest.animations{}.params{transition=2,frames[{pixels:[0..1.0],loop,fps,animationName
